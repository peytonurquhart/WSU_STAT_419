## About Me
My name is Peyton Urquhart. I'm a junior at Washington State University in Pullman
Washington, pursuing a B.S in Software Engineering. Throughout my life I have 
found it to be most efficient to put trust primarily in myself, and what I see 
with my own eyes. I would not consider myself to be a good listener unless I ask
a specific question to someone whom I trust to give me the right answer. In many
cases I would rather sit with a challenging problem for hours than ask somebody
for help, and that is because I enjoy doing so. I would not consider myself an 
introvert or an extrovert, but somewhere in between. Work/life balance comes very 
natural to me. For example, if I spend all day in my room working on a programming
project, I find myself wanting to invite a friend over and have a conversation.
If I spend all day with a friend, all I want to do is sit down and work on
a project alone. I find a similar amount of joy and satisfaction in connecting with
others as I do solving a problem by myself.

As a child in school, I don't believe I ever really grasped mathematics. I understood
how to do the problems, I understood that I had to be good at math to graduate
high school, I understood that to build a house you need to calculate
angles and areas, but I didn't understand that math was a tool we could use
to explain each and every aspect of reality.

Being competitive in nature, I have always enjoyed games of all sorts. I like 
physical games, creative games, games of skill, and games of probability. My 
introduction to computer programming was in early high school when I
discovered a YouTube video of somebody modifying the videogame Minecraft. It was 
interesting to me that he was able to open a file, change some numbers, and
the behavior of the game was different. From that point forward, I ran my own 
Minecraft server (which I hosted on my mom's laptop), modified the game to include
firearms, created a website for my server, implemented an automated credit card payment 
system for in-game items, and after that was all said and done walked away with
about $80 more than I started with. Not a very good return for hundreds of hours
of work, nevertheless, I was hooked on computer programming. More importantly,
I had a major realization about how one could use math and logic to describe 
complex systems, a connection I had never made in school.

Currently in my life, I am occupied by my studies. I have a passion for the 
program I am in and genuinely enjoy every second of it. During my free time, I
work on my side projects. To name a few, a game-engine written in C++ and OpenGL,
a stock trading bot in C# interfacing the Alpaca API (not for financial gain, 
just for fun), a network of Texas Holdem poker game-servers written in Python, and 
client written in C#. I also enjoy the game of poker and understand it on a deep
level. Using solid math to put opponents at a disadvantage is a fun idea to me. 
During the winter I love to downhill ski, and during the summer I love to fish.
I use the Instacart app to deliver groceries and put half of the profits towards 
investments and the other half is for some spending money while with friends.

## Background
My father John Urquhart was raised in Smithtown, New York. Growing up he found
his peace in the outdoors and dreamed of one day leaving New York to reside in
a place more suitable for him. When the time came for him to go to college, he 
packed his bags and left for Missoula, to study Forestry at The University of 
Montana. During his sophomore year, after taking an optional course in computer 
science, his interests changed. John switched his major and graduated with a 
degree in computer science in 1987. Shortly after graduation, he left for 
Seattle Washington and began working at Boeing, maintaining their payroll system. 
	
While living in Seattle, John met my mother Betsy, a lifelong resident of 
Seattle. Betsy's father Larry also worked as a computer scientist at Boeing. 
They got Married. My father put a down payment on a duplex to live in with my 
mother and rented out one of the units in an effort to live at a lower cost. 
About three years later, on March 27, 2000, I- Peyton John Urquhart, was born. 
In two more years came my only sibling Cameron Urquhart. My parents had since 
moved out of the duplex into a family-oriented home in Black Diamond, a small
city about 30 miles southeast of Seattle.
	
Cameron and I were raised in a conservative household. Our grandparents on our 
mothers side, Larry and Kathy Lee, played a large role in our upbringing. With 
both my father and grandfather being computer scientists, naturally, I grew up 
around computers, however, at no point in my childhood was I introduced to 
computer science. In fact, my most vivid memories growing up are from my 
experience with the outdoors.
	
Each summer, my mother's side of the family held a reunion at Hill's Resort on 
Priest Lake in northern Idaho. This was and continues to be, my favorite place 
of all time. Kathy's parents (my great grandparents) rented a whole lodge at 
the resort for a week in August. Some of my favorite memories are learning to 
water-ski, taking hikes into the mountains, and building campfires on the beach. 
My great grandparents have since passed, and the family tradition has come to 
an end. These memories play a role in who I have become as a person. I consider 
myself to be adventurous, daring, and family-oriented, with a passion for
outdoor activity.

As the real estate market gained momentum approaching 2006, my father began
to spend more time planning real estate investments. While working at Boeing, 
he spent his free time obtaining his real estate license. During this process 
he met a man named Aaron Cunningham, originally from Spokane Washington. 
Aaron and himself searched the market for homes to repair and sell for a profit. 
One day he returned home with news that would change the trajectory of our lives. 
With hard work and a considerable amount of luck, the pair closed a single deal 
worth more than my father's entire years salary at Boeing. 
  
By early 2007, my father had quit his job to pursue real estate full time. 
During the housing market crash of 2008, Aaron's other business partners began 
to alert the pair about an abundant supply of cheap foreclosure properties
being auctioned in Spokane. As the two of them capitalized on these opportunities
they spent a greater amount of time in eastern Washington. Eventually, my
family decided it would be best to move to Spokane. Aaron and his family
followed.
  
When I was twelve my grandpa retired from a successful career at Boeing and 
my grandparents moved to Spokane along-side us, just seven houses down the street.
Aaron and my father went on to found their own private-money-lending company 
called Inland Capital, to assist other short-term real estate investors. I spent 
the greater portion of my childhood in Spokane, attending elementary, middle, 
and high school there.

## Future
I have two important priorities for my future. Number one is financial freedom,
number two is to get to an environment where I am surrounded by the necessary people,
and have access to the necessary tools to fuel innovation and create something
great. I assign these career oriented priorities the highest level of importance 
because I believe that it is crucial to form personal relationships with like-minded
individuals, and those individuals are most likely found on the road to a
common destination.

My ultimate goal is to, like my father, have my own company. It seems to be a
better quality of life being your own boss, and I would prefer to lead than to 
follow. I could also see myself being very satisfied working for someone else as
long as I have a passion for the work and am inspired by the product. The other
option would be working towards a goal that I fundamentally disagree with, or
spending large chunks of my life creating a product that I have no passion for.
To me that is not living, and every day I wake up and work in order to make sure 
that is not the case.

Specifically, I am actively searching for a summer internship for the summer
of 2021, and hope to graduate a semester early to start a career as soon as possible.
