  Data from IMDB is analyzed for actors Will Smith and Denzel Washington. This
  report aims to portray Denzel Washington as a better overall actor than Will
  Smith. The angle I took for this report was to analyze critic ratings across
  genres for the actors. Audience ratings are also briefly covered.

\section{Commentary}
\label{sec:commentary}
\doublespacing

\noindent Denzel Washington has higher critic ratings on average in 10/12 of the 
genres which are common among Will and himself. Included in these "green genres"
are the most popular genres among the two actors: Action and Comedy. \newline

\noindent Will out-performs Denzel in the Adventure genre by only a small margin
of 0.3/100. Additionally, the genre where Will is found to perform much better,
documentaries, could hardly be considered acting in the first place. \newline

\section{Commentary}
\label{sec:commentary}
\doublespacing

\noindent In addition to Denzel achieving much higher critic-ratings in general,
he also recieved much stronger ratings from the audience. \newline

\noindent Where Will out-performed Denzel in the adventure category with the
critics, the audience disagrees.\newline


\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\noindent To say that one of these two actors is fundamentally a better actor,
I believe the most important points to examine are their artistic ability as
an actor, and how much the audience enjoys their work. With Denzel dominating in
both these categories it is fair to say that he is a better actor than Will Smith.

\section{Submission-Notes}
\label{sec:submission-notes}

\noindent The lack of content in comparison to my Will-is-better submission can
be explained by my one-graphic. I focused on crating a graphic that conveyed
more information this time. It took my quite a while to figure out which tool
I actually needed to use to put plots in a grid and format it correctly. \newline

\noindent Additionally, I added support for Inflation-adjustment in my functions-IMDB
that I have tested, and will use for the final project.
