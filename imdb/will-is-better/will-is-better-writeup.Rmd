  Data from IMDB is analyzed for actors Will Smith and Denzel Washington. This
  report aims to portray Will Smith as a better actor than Denzel Washginton.
  The approach I found best was to contrast the financial and popular
  careers of the actors (rather than critic/audience ratings).

\section{Questions}
\label{sec:questions}

\doublespacing

Denzel Washington has a slightly higher audience and critic rating across genres,
however, actors, producers, and other members of the film industry don't put food
on the table by receiving good reviews. Between two well-known actors, how is it 
such that one is rated slightly higher across the board but the other performs better
financially and achieves greater popularity? \newline

\noindent Something I would like to explore is an actors ability to star in "Blockbuster"
movies. These are movies which are exceptionally popular and financially successful.
I will call this "Blockbuster-Ability". \newline

\noindent To display this visually, I have taken the average revenue of movies for both
actors year-by-year, starting at the beginning of their careers and ending in 2020.
(Figure 5) Taking the yearly-average in this scenario limits the possibility for an actor
to star in 5-or-6 "average" movies and obscure the visual when looking for the 
existence of blockbusters. \newline

\noindent The same can be said for the IMDB "votes" popularity metric year-by-year. (Figure 6)

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The visuals make it clear that Will Smith is consistently able to "Knock it out
of the park" with his performances at a greater scale then Denzel Washington. \newline

\noindent The higher peaks on the visual: "Average Box Office Sales Over Time" (Figure 5)
indicate that his performances have consistently brought more revenue on average,
and include a greater probability for a blockbuster movie. This is re-enforced 
(although not quite as unmistakably) in the visual "Actor Popularity Over Time" (Figure 6) \newline

\noindent In Conclusion, it is clearly in the best financial interest of any 
producer to cast Will Smith rather than Denzel Washington. In every practical
sense, Will Smith is the better actor.
